#### AnhyLibAPI

AnhyShop requires the installation of the **AnhyLibAPI** library version 1.5.2 or higher. This library ensures the plugin's stability and efficiency, providing translation for system messages and multilingual names for traders.

#### AnhyLingo (Optional)

AnhyShop is compatible with **AnhyLingo** version 0.3.3 or higher. Installing AnhyLingo enhances AnhyShop's multilingual capabilities by adding support for multilingual items in trades. However, the absence of AnhyLingo does not affect the core functionality of AnhyShop.
