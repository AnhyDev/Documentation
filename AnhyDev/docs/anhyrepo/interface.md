#### User Interface

- **Inventory Clicks:** Left-clicking an item in the inventory inserts the necessary text into the command line. Right-clicking returns to the main menu.
- **Visualization:** Icons for entries are distinct: a command block for commands, a sheet of paper for short messages, and a book and quill for longer texts.
