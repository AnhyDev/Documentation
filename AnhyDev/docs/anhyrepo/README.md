#### Overview

**AnhyRepo** is a plugin designed for creating and managing "repositories"â€”personal storage spaces for commands or text messages in Minecraft. These repositories can be used to quickly insert text into the command line or chat, with the option to edit the text beforehand.

##### Essential Dependencies for **AnhyRepo**

To function properly, **AnhyRepo** requires the **AnhyLibAPI** library version 1.5.2 or higher. Without **AnhyLibAPI**, **AnhyRepo** will not work.

Additionally, **AnhyRepo** is compatible with **AnhyLingo**. However, its absence does not affect the operation of AnhyRepo. Furthermore, the **AnhyRepo** plugin includes its own commands for changing players' language settings, which modify the same player data as the **AnhyLingo** plugin, making it an alternative to **AnhyLingo** in this regard. There are no conflicts between the plugins.
