The AnhyFamily plugin provides a flexible permission system to manage access to various features and commands. Below is a description of each permission and its purpose.

- **`family.admin`**  
  Allows executing administrative commands, including managing family ties, forcibly changing gender, and other moderator functions.

- **`family.user`**  
  Allows players to marry and adopt other players. This permission is required for basic social interaction within the plugin.

- **`family.pastor`**  
  Allows priests to conduct wedding ceremonies and propose changes to players' names and surnames. This permission is necessary for performing the role of a priest on the server.

- **`family.tphome`**  
  Allows players to use the command to teleport to the family home, bypassing all restrictions.

- **`family.chest.ignore.distance`**  
  Allows players to open the family chest regardless of the distance to it.

- **`family.chest.ignore.world`**  
  Allows players to open the family chest via command, bypassing world restrictions. This enables access to the chest from different game worlds.

- **`family.chest.click`**  
  Allows players to open the family chest by clicking, even if click access is prohibited.

- **`family.chest.break`**  
  Allows players to break the family chest.

Each of these permissions can be configured through a permission management plugin, enabling server administrators to precisely control which features are accessible to different player groups.
