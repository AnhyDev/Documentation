# Detailed Implementation of AnhyLibAPI Features

### 1. Multilingual Support

AnhyLibAPI implements a unified standard for multilingual support by checking "Player Persistent Data" for the player's selected language. If a selected language is not found, the player's Minecraft client language is used by default. Additionally, it supports the inclusion of a list of preferred languages, enhancing flexibility in localization.

### 2. NBT Tags Handling

AnhyLibAPI simplifies the addition, modification, and deletion of NBT tags in items, enabling developers to effortlessly manage key item data within the game.

### 3. Player Persistent Data

This feature allows for the storage, retrieval, and modification of players' personal data, such as settings, statuses, and achievements, providing deep personalization and preservation of individual player details.

### 4. Customizing Messages and Logging

These functionalities offer message customization and color-coded logging for various message types. They enhance communication between plugins and players and facilitate more effective tracking and analysis of events within plugins.
